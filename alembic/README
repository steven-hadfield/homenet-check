Generic single-database configuration.

When run from within homenet-check, the configuration should be inherited.
If running alembic directly, you may need to modify the [alembic.ini](../alembic.ini) file
if you are not using the standard database configuration or ensure that your homenet configuration is located at (project-dir)/config.json
